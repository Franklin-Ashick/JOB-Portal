# JOB-Portal
Its a Job Searching and Posting website is a platform that caters to both job seekers and recruiters. It is built using ASP.net, C#, and SQL Server for the database.

The website has two main pages - one for job seekers and one for recruiters. Job seekers can view jobs that are based on their graduation course. 
They can apply for the job and then take an aptitude test related to their course. Once they pass the test, their application is submitted, and 
they are in the running for the job.

Recruiters, on the other hand, can post jobs, view candidates who have applied for the job, and see the selected candidates. When a recruiter posts a job, 
it is verified by the admin to ensure that it is not fake. Once the admin approves the job posting, it is displayed to job seekers on the website.

The admin has access to all the user accounts and can remove them if needed. They can also see all the jobs that have been posted, the questions and 
answers related to every course, and even edit, add or delete them.

In addition to the job seeker and recruiter pages, the website also has other pages such as the login page, registration page, and admin dashboard. 
The admin dashboard provides the admin with real-time data about the website's activities, such as the number of users, the number of posted jobs, and 
the number of selected candidates.

Overall, JOB-Portal is a website which is designed to provide job seekers with an easy way to find jobs that are related to their graduation course. 
It also provides recruiters with a platform to post jobs and find suitable candidates. The website's use of an aptitude test ensures that only qualified 
candidates apply for the job, and the admin's verification process adds an additional layer of security to the job posting process.
